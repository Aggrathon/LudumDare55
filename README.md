# The Lazy Archdemon - Ludum Dare 55

You have been chosen to herald the invasion of earth!
Can you overwhelm the defenders before the archdemon gets bored and decides to replace you?

A reverse tower defence game / idle game.

My entry to the 55:th Ludum Dare game jam (theme: *Summoning*), following the compo rules (alone, from scratch, 48 hours).

## Software Used

Bevy (game engine), space_editor (game editor), Visual Studio Code (code), Rust (language), Audacity (sound), Blender (graphics), Macondo (font), git (version control), and Github (hosting).


## Developer commentary

I would have liked add more content (and models for the units), but spent too much time just setting things up (the drawback of using a less mature engine and even less mature editor).
I added the UI relatively late, but I really felt the game coming together after that, so maybe I should try prioritising the UI earlier next time?
